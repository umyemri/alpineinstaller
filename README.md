# Alpine Laptop Installer

Based on the instruction from the wiki: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_a_laptop

## Impressions

So far I did a basic install of Alpine to my Dell XPS 13 9360 with regular setup-alpine. Works just fine. Did a git clone of dwm, compiled it and my laptop functions more or less the same as my Arch build.

I'll need to write up some notes for an encrypted build, but it looks like it's just a combo of cfdisk, chroot and cryptsetup. Some trial and error and I should be good.

The test build has been religated to a Acer C720 Chromebook (as I prefer to run Arch on my Dell).
